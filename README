# Docker branch

Contains everything to build the docker container which then builds Linux binaries.

## Continous Integration

The .gitlab-ci.yml contains three build stages. Any change pushed to the docker branch will:

1. build: builds a new Docker image
2. test:using the new image, try to build the unstable branch
3. release: if the test stage succeeds, tag the newly build image and push to the docker registry.
